# Social-Media-Analytics-With-SQL



# Project Overview:-

This project focuses on creating a  social media database, it has designed for seamless integration with a frontend interface. The database manages various aspects of social media activity like  including user data, followers,  and public interactions such as post likes, comments , followed, and it's add to the time or date in social media activity such as a like, post, date of account create, and more.

# Key Features:- 

→ User Data Management: The database efficiently handles multiple user  profiles, tracking their followers , and interactions on the platform activity.

→ Social Activity: I have designed the system to track all social media activities such as likes, comments, and read message, sent message or comment.

→ SQL Queries: Through well-structured SQL queries, I establish the relationships between different entities such as users_info, post, notification and many more. The queries highlight the connections between social media activities.

→ Data Storage: Media files like images  are stored in their true form via URLs, to ensuring that storage is optimized for scalability without compromising the data.

→ Error Handling: I have incorporated error handling mechanisms to ensure that missing or incomplete data doesn't disrupt the user experience and reliable system.
